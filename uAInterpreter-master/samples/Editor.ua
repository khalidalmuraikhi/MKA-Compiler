; A simple text editor
; Behaviour:
;  - shows the cursor by alternating the cursor chars and the current
;       content of the text at the cursor's location
;  - arrow keys allow moving around the text
;  - if the cursor reaches the top or the bottom of the screen, then scrolls
;       the content in the direction of the pressed arrow
;  - when a visible character is pressed >32 <127 the character is shown at
;       the current cursor location and the cursor is moved to the right
;  - if the cursor reaches the end of the line it just stays there (i.e., 
;       there could be no more than 80 chars per line)
;  - as there is no disk in uA, you cannot store the data to it.. anything you
;       write will be lost once you close the interpreter's window.

; Memory layout of the program:
; 10000-19999 (5 full pages of text)
; 0-1999 the current view - i.e., the screen
; 20000 the position of the current view e.g., 10000 for the topmost line,
;			10080 for the next
; 20001 the position of the cursor on the screen i.e., 0-1999
; 20003 pointer to the current cursor shape
; 20004 cursor blink: if 1 then cursor shape is show, if 0 then the actual
;			content 
; 25000 register A is saved here by functions
; 25001 register B is saved here by functions
; 25002 register C is saved here by functions
; 25003 register D is saved here by functions

; Relevant key codes:
; Backspace: 8
; Enter: 10
; ESC: 27
; Space: 32
; Left arrow: 37
; Up arrow: 38
; Right arrow: 39
; Down arrow: 40

; This sample shows features like:
; 1. Function calls with return locations pushed via a register. 
;      see the label bufferedtocursor
; 2. Modulo 80, shown just before the exit label
; 3. "Switch" statement check the consecutive jumps for labels:
;   a) notEnter
;   b) notESC
;   c) notLeftArrow
;   d) notUpArrow
;   e) notRightArrow
;   f) notDownArrow
; 4. Demonstrates how the JZC conditional jump can be used for
;      a wide variety of conditions (like lower than, bigger than
;      or even equals)
; 5. Shows how to simply save register state in between function
;      calls. WARNING: this does not allow nested function calls!
