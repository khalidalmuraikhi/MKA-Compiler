;An infinite scroller on the first line with asterisks

; This sample shows features like:
; 1. Creating busy waiting based delays for a somewhat precise timing.
;	     This enables us to have behaviour linked to the passing of time.
; 2. How to handle variables stored in memory
;        We use the memory address 10000 for our first variable 
;          - this will be used to see where should we put the asterisk next
;               -  1 = to the right of the current pos
;               - -1 = to the left of the current pos
; 3. Setting up the initial conditions, and initialising our variables.
;        See actions directly following the "entry" label.
; 4. How to check if a value is negative or positive 
;        See the operations around the label "posDir".
; 5. How to ensure the key information is kept unchanged while doing other 
;        functions:
;          - Register D is the location of the asterisk, and is not used for
;                any other purpose. From a higher level language's perspective
;                this would mean a variable (e.g., called "location") was 
;                pinned to a register. Notice that changes on D are only done
;                in setup and repaint phases.
;          - The other variable of ours (direction) does not have its own
;                register, it is constantly saved and loaded from memory.
;                See operations like LDC/STC 10000,x .
